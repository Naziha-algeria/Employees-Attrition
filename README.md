HR Attrition Analysis Project This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within a company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors that influence whether an employee is likely to leave or stay, and to support data-driven decision-making in human resources.

🔍 Key Objectives: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on HR data.

Clean, transform, and encode relevant features.

Train and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier to predict attrition.

Measure model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Identify the most important features influencing attrition.

Generate an automated and structured PDF report summarizing the findings.

📊 Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

FPDF for automated PDF report generation

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

📁 Output: Model accuracy and feature importance

A new column with predicted attrition vs actual

A clean and printable PDF report with insights
